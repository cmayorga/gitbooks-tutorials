Non-Fungible tokens \(NFTs\) enable new types of collectible digital assets as well as new infrastructure for blockchain-based games.  NFTs have captured a lot of developer mindshare since the interface was first published as an EIP in September of 2017. **Non-Fungible tokens allow developers to tokenize ownership of any arbitrary data**, while drastically increasing the design space  and usability aspects of blockchain solutions \[[1](https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/erc-721-tokens/)\].

The biggest differentiator of Non-Fungible tokens is that each one is tied to a different identifier, **making each token unique to its owner**. For example on Ethereum blockchain [ERC721](http://erc721.org/) is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens, meaning ERC721 tokens are simply a subset of Ethereum tokens.
