# Introduction To Digital Assets \(NFTs\)

Digital Assets represent anything that can be saved on the blockchain and backed with a traceable and uniquie identifier. This in practice translates to many use-cases that can bee seen in different industries \(identity management, supply chain,  digital trading cards and collectibles, loyalty cards and fan tokens, proof of completion/ownership/authenticy and many more\).    
  
To support different industries and their use-cases we have developed a set of NFT-Core plugins and applications that enable us to quickly adopt and scale in related industry verticals.
