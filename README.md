# Introduction To Digital Assets

Digital Assets represent anything that can be saved or tagged on the blockchain supported with a traceable and **unique** identifier. This in practice translates to many use-cases that can be seen in different industries \(identity management, supply chain,  digital trading cards and collectibles, loyalty cards and fan tokens, proof of completion/ownership and many more\).    
  
To support different industries and their use-cases we have developed a set of NFT-Core plugins and applications that enable us to quickly adopt and scale in related industry verticals.

### Why use blockchain together with Digital Asset \(NFTs\) Management? 

* Digital Assets \(NFTs\) enable the creation of rare & unique items that canâ€™t be destroyed, replicated or forged 
* NFTs can be tracked on the blockchain, providing an immutable history of the assets 
* NFT cannot deteriorate over time like physical cards
* Peer-to-peer, secure trading enabled by blockchain technology 
* NFT can be sold for fan tokens, and traded / exchanged back into Fiat
