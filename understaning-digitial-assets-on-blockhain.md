# Understaning Digitial Assets On Blockhain

Non-Fungible tokens \(NFTs\) enable new types of collectible digital assets as well as new infrastructure for blockchain-based games.  NFTs have captured a lot of developer mindshare since the interface was first published as an EIP in September of 2017. **Non-Fungible tokens allow developers to tokenize ownership of any arbitrary data**, while drastically increasing the design space  and usability aspects of blockchain solutions \[[1](https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/erc-721-tokens/)\].

The biggest differentiator of Non-Fungible tokens is that each one is tied to a different identifier, **making each token unique to its owner**. For example on Ethereum blockchain [ERC721](http://erc721.org/) is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens, meaning ERC721 tokens are simply a subset of Ethereum tokens.

We developed a set of plugins to fully support NFT functionality from the creation and ownership process to the interaction and trading part for the owners of digital assets. In the next sections, we are going to explain the flow of digital asset creation \(NFT Creation\) to the basic trading functionalities support by our NFT Exchange Platform.

## Available Digital Asset Functionalities

The word Digital Asset relates to anything unique we can store and verify on the blockchain. In the ethereum landscape digital assets are powered by ERC 721 standard -  also know as NFT \(Non-Fungible token support\).   
  
We have the following processes of digital asset management built into the base layer, where we handle asset registration and creation; and the second layer is responsible for asset trading/exchange functionality - all being live and recorded on blockchain.

The image above shows the actors and top-level processes associated with them.
