# Understaning Digitial Assets On Blockhain

Non-Fungible tokens \(NFTs\) enable new types of collectible digital assets as well as new infrastructure for blockchain-based unique items.  NFTs have captured a lot of developer mindshare since the interface was first published as an EIP in September of 2017. **Non-Fungible tokens allow anyone to digitalize ownership of any arbitrary data**, while drastically increasing the design space  and usability aspects of blockchain solutions \[[1](https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/erc-721-tokens/)\].

The biggest differentiator of Non-Fungible tokens versus "regular" tokens is that each one is tied to a different identifier, **making each token unique to its owner**. For example on Ethereum blockchain [ERC721](http://erc721.org/) is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens, meaning ERC721 tokens are simply a subset of Ethereum tokens.

## Protokol NFT Functionality 

We developed a set of plugins to fully support NFT functionality from the creation and ownership process to the interaction and trading part for the owners of digital assets. In the next sections, we are going to explain the flow of digital asset creation \(NFT Creation\) to the basic trading functionalities support by our NFT Exchange Platform.
