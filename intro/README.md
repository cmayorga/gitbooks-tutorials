# Tutorials

Non-Fungible tokens \(NFTs\) enable new types of collectible digital assets as well as new infrastructure for blockchain-based games.  NFTs have captured a lot of developer mindshare since the interface was first published as an EIP in September of 2017. **Non-Fungible tokens allow developers to tokenize ownership of any arbitrary data**, while drastically increasing the design space  and usability aspects of blockchain solutions \[[1](https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/erc-721-tokens/)\].

The biggest differentiator of Non-Fungible tokens is that each one is tied to a different identifier, **making each token unique to its owner**. For example on Ethereum blockchain [ERC721](http://erc721.org/) is a standard interface for Non-Fungible tokens, meaning ERC721 tokens are simply a subset of Ethereum tokens.

The ARK Core way of doing [smart-transactions ](https://learn.ark.dev/application-development/how-to-write-custom-transactions-types)enabled us to build a flexible and dynamic **Protokol NFT** solution to run on top of existing ARK Core functionality.

This functionality is currently only operational on the develop branch of the new ARK Core v3 version.

We developed a set of plugins to fully support NFT functionality from the creation and ownership process to the interaction and trading part for the owners of digital assets. In the next sections, we are going to explain the flow of digital asset creation \(NFT Creation\) to the basic trading functionalities support by our NFT Exchange Platform.
